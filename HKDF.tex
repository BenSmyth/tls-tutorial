\subsection{Key establishment}\label{sec:hkdf}

Once a \ServerHello\ message has been sent, a shared (handshake traffic) key can be 
established, and that key can be used to enable confidentiality 
and integrity for the remainder of the handshake protocol, which includes the 
subsequent \EncryptedExtensions\ message (\S\ref{sec:EE}). The initial shared key 
is derived by application of a key derivation function, 
known as a \emph{HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function} (HKDF),
which applies the negotiated hash function to the handshake protocol's 
transcript and either the negotiated pre-shared key, the negotiated (EC)DHE key,
%(Appendix~\ref{sec:dheKey}), 
or both. Further shared (application traffic) keys can be established 
similarly, to protect additional data, including application data.
Since transcripts include client- and server-generated nonces, shared (traffic) keys
are always unique, regardless of whether the pre-shared key (or for that matter
(EC)DHE key shares) are used for multiple connections.

\subsubsection{Transcript hash}\label{sec:hkdf:transcript}

A protocol's transcript concatenates each of the protocol's 
messages, in the order that they were sent, including message headers (namely, type 
and length fields, as introduced in Section~\ref{sec:record}), 
but excluding record-layer headers. The concatenation of messages
starts with \ClientHello, optionally followed by \HelloRetryRequest\ 
and \ClientHello\ if present, and proceeded by \ServerHello.
That transcript is used in computing transcript traffic keys 
(which protect the remaining handshake messages). Thereafter, 
the concatenation of messages is extended with \EncryptedExtensions\
and optionally \CertificateRequest, \Certificate, and 
\CertificateVerify\ if sent. A MAC over that transcript 
is included in a server's \Finished\ message, and a signature
over the transcript (excluding message \CertificateVerify) is 
included in any \CertificateVerify\ message. Once extended with
that \Finished\ message, the transcript is used in computing
%
\begin{comment}
the application traffic key. 
\end{comment}
%
%% Clarified in email from Eric Rescorla, dated 11 May 2020: 
%
the application traffic keys (which protect application traffic).
Finally, for a client's \Finished\ message, the transcript
is further extended with their \EndOfEarlyData, \Certificate,  
and \CertificateVerify\ messages (as relevant), before computing a 
MAC, wherein any \CertificateVerify\ message includes a signature over
that transcript (excluding itself). 
%
\begin{comment}
Finally, the client's application
traffic key is computed after extending the transcript with the 
client's \Finished\ message.
\end{comment}


To capture a transcript hash (i.e., a hash of a transcript), 
we introduce function \TranscriptHash\ such that
%
\[
  \TranscriptHash(M_1,\dots,M_n) = \Hash(M_1 \parallel \dots \parallel M_n)
\]
%
for handshake protocol messages $M_1,\dots,M_n$ (sent in that order), where \Hash\ is the 
negotiated hash function and $\parallel$ denotes concatenation, except when 
messages $M_1$ and $M_2$ are \ClientHello\ and \HelloRetryRequest\ messages, 
respectively. In that case, $M_1$ is replaced by $M'_1$ in the hash, i.e., 
%
\[
  \TranscriptHash(M_1,\dots,M_n) = \Hash(M'_1 \parallel M_2 \parallel \dots \parallel M_n),
\]
where $M'_1$ is the following special, synthetic handshake message, 
namely, \ifSpecNotes\marginpar{Truthify, is the 0x0000 padding or something else}\fi
%
\begin{align*}
  M'_1 = 
    & \mathbin{\phantom{\parallel}}  0\textrm{x}FE &\textrm{/* header type \TLSmessageHash */}     \\
    & \parallel                      0\textrm{x}0000 \parallel \HashLength &\textrm{/* (padded) header length */} \\
    & \parallel                      \Hash(M_1) &\textrm{/* hash of \ClientHello\ message */}
\end{align*}
%
where \HashLength\ is the output length in bytes of negotiated hash function \Hash.
This special case enables servers to construct transcripts without maintaining 
state, in particular, they need not store an initial \ClientHello\ message,
since it can be stored in extension \TLScookie\ (\S\ref{sec:HRR}).\footnote{%
  \HelloRetryRequest\ messages need not be maintained by the server either, since
  they can be reconstructed from \ClientHello\ messages and the special constant
  value that is used by field \HelloRetryRequest\code{.}\TLSrandom.}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Transcript hashing is implemented by class \code{HandshakeHash} (Listing~\ref{lst:HandshakeHash}).
Instances of that class form part of the active client and server contexts (instantiated by classes 
\code{SSL\-Engine\-Impl} and \code{SSL\-Socket\-Impl}), which are updated by classes 
\code{SSL\-Engine\-Input\-Record} and \code{SSL\-Engine\-Output\-Record}, respectively classes 
\code{SSL\-Socket\-Input\-Record} and \code{SSL\-Socket\-Output\-Record}. Moreover, in the case 
of a \HelloRetryRequest\ message, it is updated by class 
\code{Server\-Hello.T13\-Hello\-Retry\-Request\-Consumer} (Listing~\ref{lst:T13HelloRetryRequestConsumerB})
and by class \code{HelloCookieManager} (Listing~\ref{lst:T13HelloCookieManager}), when consuming any 
\TLScookie\ extension associated with a corresponding \ClientHello\ message.

\subsubsection{Key derivation}\label{sec:secrets}

The key derivation process combines the negotiated pre-shared key, the 
(EC)DHE key, or both, with the protocol's transcript. The process 
uses function \HKDFExtract, which is defined by RFC~5869
such that 
%
\[
  \HKDFExtract(\TLSHKDFSalt,\TLSHKDFSecret) = 
  \left\{
    \begin{matrix*}[l]
      \HMACHash(\zeros,\TLSHKDFSecret)             & \textrm{if \TLSHKDFSalt\ is null}\\
      \HMACHash(\TLSHKDFSalt,\TLSHKDFSecret)  & \textrm{otherwise},
    \end{matrix*}
  \right.
\]
%
%parameterised by salt value $\TLSHKDFSalt$ 
%%(and is a \HashLength-length string of zeros if not provided) 
%and secret $\TLSHKDFSecret$, 
where $\zeros$ denotes a \HashLength-length string of zeros
\ifSpecNotes
\textcolor{red}{Rather than \zeros, The spec uses 0, which isn't particularly intuitive, 
since it can be confused for, well, integer 0. We deviate for clarity.}
\fi
(and function \HMACHash\ is specified by RFC~2104 over keys and messages, hence, the above
definition treats $\TLSHKDFSalt$ as a key and $\TLSHKDFSecret$ 
as a message when applying \HMACHash).
In the context of key derivation, 
the salt is initially $\zeros$ 
and the secret is initially the pre-shared key or $\zeros$ if no such 
key was negotiated. The function's first output is known 
as \TLSEarlySecret. It follows that
\[
  \TLSEarlySecret = \HKDFExtract(\zeros,\textrm{PSK}),
\]
where PSK is $\zeros$ for (EC)DHE-only key exchange and
otherwise the pre-shared key, which provides raw 
entropy without context.
Context is added using function \DeriveSecret, defined 
such that 
%
\[
  \DeriveSecret(\TLSHKDFSecret,\TLSHKDFLabel,\TLSHandshakeMessage) 
    %= \HKDFExpandLabel(\TLSHKDFSecret, \TLSHKDFLabel, \TranscriptHash(\TLSHandshakeMessage), \HashLength)
      %= \HKDFExpand(\TLSHKDFSecret,\TLSHKDFLabelExt,\HashLength)
        %= \HMACHash(\TLSHKDFSecret, ``" \parallel \TLSHKDFLabelExt \parallel 0\textrm{x}01), \marginpar{Does $``" \parallel M = M$? If so, simplify left}
          = \HMACHash\left(\TLSHKDFSecret, \TLSHKDFLabelExt \parallel 0\textrm{x}01\right),
\]
%
%parameterised by secret \TLSHKDFSecret\ and label \TLSHKDFLabel, 
where \TLSHandshakeMessage\ is a concatenation of the protocol's messages (\S\ref{sec:hkdf:transcript})
and $\TLSHKDFLabelExt$ is defined as the following message,\footnote{
  RFC 8446 defines function \DeriveSecret\ in terms of functions \HKDFExpandLabel\
  and \HKDFExpand, namely,
  $\DeriveSecret(\allowbreak\TLSHKDFSecret,\allowbreak\TLSHKDFLabel,\allowbreak\TLSHandshakeMessage) 
    = \HKDFExpandLabel(\allowbreak\TLSHKDFSecret,\allowbreak \TLSHKDFLabel,\allowbreak \TranscriptHash(\TLSHandshakeMessage),\allowbreak \HashLength)
      = \HKDFExpand(\allowbreak\TLSHKDFSecret,\allowbreak \TLSHKDFLabelExt,\allowbreak \HashLength)
        = \HMACHash(\allowbreak\TLSHKDFSecret,\allowbreak %``" \parallel 
                                \TLSHKDFLabelExt \parallel 0\textrm{x}01)$, 
  where $\TLSHKDFLabelExt = \HashLength \parallel ``\textrm{tls13\textvisiblespace}" \parallel \TLSHKDFLabel \parallel \TranscriptHash(\TLSHandshakeMessage)$.
  By comparison, we define function \DeriveSecret\ more directly and defer the 
  additional functions to Section~\ref{sec:hkdf:trafficKeys}, where we consider
  functions \HKDFExpandLabel\ and \HKDFExpand\ more generally (in particular,
  the former may omit transcript hashes in favour of strings and the latter
  may consider lengths other than \HashLength).
}
namely,
\[
  \TLSHKDFLabelExt = \HashLength \parallel ``\textrm{tls13\textvisiblespace}" \parallel \TLSHKDFLabel \parallel \TranscriptHash(\TLSHandshakeMessage).
\]
Function \DeriveSecret\ is used (with the empty context) to derive salt for subsequent
applications of \HKDFExtract. Indeed, we have
\[
  \TLSHandshakeSecret = \HKDFExtract(\DeriveSecret(\TLSEarlySecret, ``\textrm{derived}", ``"),\textrm{K}),
\]
where \textrm{K} is \zeros\ for PSK-only key exchange and
otherwise the (EC)DHE key, moreover, 
\[
  \TLSMasterSecret = \HKDFExtract(\DeriveSecret(\TLSHandshakeSecret, ``\textrm{derived}", ``"),\zeros),
\]
%
noting that \TranscriptHash(``'') = \Hash(``''), that is, the hash of the empty string
(null ASCII character 0x00).
Traffic secrets are derived from \TLSEarlySecret, \TLSHandshakeSecret, and \TLSMasterSecret, 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:keyDerivation}, by adding context. Those secrets are used to 
derive traffic keys (\S\ref{sec:hkdf:trafficKeys}) to protect the data summarised in the 
following table:

\subsubsection{Traffic keys}\label{sec:hkdf:trafficKeys}

Traffic keys are derived from traffic secrets listed in Table~\ref{table:secrets}, using 
function \HKDFExpandLabel, defined such that
%
\begin{multline*}
  \HKDFExpandLabel(\TLSHKDFSecret, \TLSHKDFLabel, \TLSContext, \TLSHKDFLength) \\
    = \HKDFExpand(\TLSHKDFSecret, \TLSHKDFLabelExt, \TLSHKDFLength),
\end{multline*}
%
where $\TLSHKDFLabelExt = \TLSHKDFLength \parallel ``\textrm{tls13\textvisiblespace}" \parallel \TLSHKDFLabel \parallel \TLSContext$
and function \HKDFExpand\ is defined by RFC 5869 such that
$
  \HKDFExpand(\TLSHKDFSecret,\allowbreak \TLSHKDFExpLabel,\allowbreak \TLSHKDFLength)
$
outputs the first \TLSHKDFLength-bytes of $T_1 \parallel \dots \parallel T_n$, where
$n = \lceil \frac{\TLSHKDFLength}{\HashLength} \rceil$ and 
%
\begin{align*}
  T_0 &= ``" \\
  T_1 &= \HMACHash(\TLSHKDFSecret, T_0 \parallel \TLSHKDFExpLabel \parallel 0\textrm{x}01 ) \\
  T_2 &= \HMACHash(\TLSHKDFSecret, T_1 \parallel \TLSHKDFExpLabel \parallel 0\textrm{x}02 ) \\
  &\vdots
\end{align*}

\noindent
Function \HKDFExpandLabel\ may input \TLSContext\ as the null ASCII character 0x00, denoted ``''.


\begin{tcolorbox}
Function \HKDFExpand\ is implemented by class \code{HKDF} (Listing~\ref{lst:HKDFB}) and
traffic keys are derived by class \code{SSLTrafficKeyDerivation} (Listing~\ref{lst:SSLTrafficKeyDerivation}).

Returning to key derivation, we derive the following traffic keys:
%
\begin{align*}
  \TLSwriteKey &= \HKDFExpandLabel(\TLSField{[secret]}, ``key", ``", key\_length) \\
  \TLSwriteIV  &= \HKDFExpandLabel(\TLSField{[secret]}, ``iv", ``", iv\_length)
\end{align*}
%
where \TLSField{[sender]} is either \TLSField{client} or \TLSField{server}, and
\TLSField{[secret]} is taken from the secrets listed in Table~\ref{table:secrets}.

\begin{tcolorbox}
Server- and client-side handshake-traffic key derivation is implemented by classes 
\code{Server\-Hello.T13\-Server\-Hello\-Producer} %(Listing~\ref{lst:T13ServerHelloProducerC})
and \code{Server\-Hello.T13\-Server\-Hello\-Consumer}, %(Listing~\ref{lst:T13ServerHelloConsumerB}), 
respectively.
The former class defines method \code{produce} to write a \ServerHello\ message to an 
output stream (Listings~\ref{lst:T13ServerHelloProducer} 
\&~\ref{lst:T13ServerHelloProducerB}), and that method derives handshake-traffic 
keys immediately after writing the \ServerHello\ message; the keys are used to encrypt subsequent 
outgoing handshake messages (including an \EncryptedExtensions\ message) and to decrypt subsequent
incoming handshake messages. Similarly, the latter class defines 
method \code{consume} to read a \ServerHello\ message from an input buffer 
(Listing~\ref{lst:T13ServerHelloConsumer}), and that method derives handshake-traffic 
keys immediately before reading an \EncryptedExtensions\ message (and prior to reading 
further extensions, including \Certificate\ and \CertificateVerify\ messages 
for (EC)DHE-only key exchange, and a \Finished\ message); the keys are used to decrypt subsequent
incoming handshake messages, including that \EncryptedExtensions\ message, and to encrypt subsequent
outgoing handshake messages.
The implementations 
are identical up to contexts (namely, \code{Server\-Handshake\-Context} and 
\code{Client\-Handshake\-Context}, that share parent \code{Handshake\-Context}), 
labels 
%hack for visible space:
{\code{s}\textvisiblespace{}\code{hs}\textvisiblespace{}\code{traffic}} and 
{\code{c}\textvisiblespace{}\code{hs}\textvisiblespace{}\code{traffic}}
(which are instantiated by enum \code{SSL\-Secret\-Derivation.Secret\-Schedule}
using strings \code{TlsServerHandshakeTrafficSecret} and 
\code{TlsClientHandshakeTrafficSecret}, respectively), treatment of null
in tricks to make the compiler happy (cf. \code{return null;} and \code{return;}
in catch-branches), $\alpha$-renaming of one variable, and whitespace
(and some obsolete, commented-out code). 
(Refactoring could eliminate unnecessary code.\footnote{%
  The OpenJDK team are aware of refactoring opportunities 
  (\url{https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2020-May/021928.html})
  and are tracking changes (\url{https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8245983}).
}) 
So, for brevity, we only present server-side handshake-traffic key derivation 
(Listings~\ref{lst:T13ServerHelloProducerC} \&~\ref{lst:T13ServerHelloProducerD}).

\begin{comment}
Derivation is dependent on \TLSEarlySecret\ and 
the negotiated (EC)DHE key (PSK-only key exchange is unsupported), 
which are computed by classes \code{DHKeyExchange.DHEKAGenerator.DHEKAKeyDerivation} and
\code{ECDHKeyExchange.ECDHEKAKeyDerivation}. Those classes
are identical up to constructor names, strings \code{"DiffieHellman"}
and \code{"ECDH"}, and whitespace. (Refactoring could elimate
unnecessary code.) So, for brevity, we only present the 
former class (Listing~\ref{lst:DHEKAKeyDerivation}).

Traffic secrets \TLSclientHandshakeTrafficSecret\ and \TLSserverHandshakeTrafficSecret\
are used to derive handshake-traffic keys that protect handshake extensions (\S\ref{sec:EE} 
\&~\ref{sec:handshakeAuth}). After those extensions are processed,
application-traffic keys to protect application data can be derived (\S\ref{sec:FIN}).
