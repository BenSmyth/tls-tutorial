The Internet delivered in excess of forty terabytes per second in 2017 (Cisco, 2018), 
and over half of today's Internet traffic is encrypted (Sandvine, 2018); enabling trade 
worth trillions of dollars (Statista, 2017). Yet, the underlying encryption technology 
is only understood by a select few. This manuscript broadens understanding by exploring 
TLS, an encryption technology used to protect application layer communication (including 
HTTP, FTP and SMTP traffic), and by examining Oracle's Java implementation. We focus on 
the most recent TLS release, namely, version 1.3, which is defined by RFC 8446.
