# tls-tutorial

We are nearing an all-encrypted Internet; yet, the underlying encryption technology 
is understood by only a select few. This manuscript broadens understanding by exploring TLS, 
an encryption technology used to protect application layer communication (including HTTP, 
FTP and SMTP traffic), and by examining OpenJDK's Java implementation. We focus on 
the most recent TLS release, namely, version 1.3, which is defined by RFC~8446.
