\subsection{Server parameters: \EncryptedExtensions}\label{sec:EE}

%%Endpoints may include extensions beyond those already discussed to request extended
%%functionality. A client includes such extensions in \ClientHello\ messages, whereas 
%%a server includes such extensions in an \EncryptedExtensions\ message (which must 
%%follow immediately after a \ServerHello\ message)\sout{, typically in response to extended 
%%functionality requested by the client, but also to indicate additional functionality 
%%that does not require a response from the client}\textcolor{red}{not true for 
%%\EncryptedExtensions\ messages: "Implementations MUST NOT send extension responses 
%%if the remote endpoint did not send the corresponding extension requests, with the
%%exception of the "cookie" extension in the HelloRetryRequest." It follows that
%%\EncryptedExtensions\ messages only contain responses to requests in \ClientHello\ 
%%messages.

To request extended functionality, a client may include extensions -- beyond those 
already discussed -- in \ClientHello\ messages. Such functionality 
is not required to establish handshake-traffic keys, hence, those extensions 
can be encrypted, and a server responds to client requests by including extensions 
in \EncryptedExtensions\ and \Certificate\ messages.
(Appendix~\ref{sec:extensions} lists all extensions and formally states which extensions 
can be listed in the \TLSextensions\ field of \EncryptedExtensions\ and \Certificate\ 
messages, and of other handshake protocol messages.) The former message lists extensions 
which are not associated with individual certificates, and the latter lists those that are. 

An \EncryptedExtensions\ message (which must follow immediately after a \ServerHello\ 
message) comprises of the following field:

\begin{description}

\item \TLSextensions: A list of extensions responding to requests for extended 
  functionalities, i.e., functionalities not required to establish  handshake-traffic 
  keys (hence, can be encrypted with such keys), excluding extensions 
  associated with individual certificates.

\end{description}

\noindent
Each \EncryptedExtensions\ message is encrypted using the handshake-traffic key generated 
from traffic secret \TLSserverHandshakeTrafficSecret, as are subsequent 
handshake messages sent by the server.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\EncryptedExtensions\ messages are implemented, produced, and consumed by 
inner-classes of class \code{EncryptedExtensions}, namely, inner-classes \code{EncryptedExtensionsMessage},
\code{EncryptedExtensionsProducer}, and \code{EncryptedExtensionsConsumer}, respectively.

\textcolor{red}{Perhaps explain how \code{writeCipher} encrypts traffic.}
